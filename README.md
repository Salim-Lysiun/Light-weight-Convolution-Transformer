This repo contain pytorch implementation of Lightweight convolution transformer for cross-patient seizure detection in multi-channel EEG signals as explained in the [Lightweight convolution transformer](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2023.107856) paper. This Transformer architecture is from the Convolutioni for official implementation of this paper visit [here](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Compact-Transformers)
